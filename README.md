# Accessibility Issues Demo - Learning Guide

## üìä Automated Accessibility Report

This project‚Äôs GitHub Actions workflow now generates a detailed HTML accessibility report on every run.

### How it works

- After running automated accessibility tests, the workflow creates an `accessibility-report.html` file.
- The report summarizes all violations for both the ‚Äúissues‚Äù and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù demo pages, with clear descriptions and affected elements.
- The HTML report is uploaded as a workflow artifact for easy download and review.

### How to view the report

1. Push your changes or open a pull request to trigger the workflow.
2. Go to the ‚ÄúActions‚Äù tab in your GitHub repository.
3. Select the latest workflow run.
4. Download the `axe-results` artifact.
5. Open `accessibility-report.html` in your browser for a full, readable summary of the results.


This project demonstrates common web accessibility issues and their solutions. The goal is to help developers understand what makes websites inaccessible and how to fix these problems.

## ü§ñ How to Recreate This Project with GitHub Copilot (Claude 4)

If you want to recreate this accessibility demo project using GitHub Copilot with Claude 4, here's the exact prompt that generated this comprehensive example:

### Prompt for GitHub Copilot:
```
create a simple html file to showcase how to fix accessibility issues. make the page deliberately non accessibility with a few issues. use plain html
```

### What Claude 4 Generated:
Claude 4 understood this request and automatically created:

1. **Two HTML files** - One with accessibility issues and one with fixes
2. **Comprehensive documentation** - This README with detailed explanations
3. **Real-world examples** - 13+ common accessibility violations and their solutions
4. **WCAG compliance mapping** - Each issue mapped to specific WCAG guidelines
5. **Testing guidance** - How to test accessibility manually and with tools

### Why This Prompt Worked Well:

- **Clear objective**: "showcase how to fix accessibility issues"
- **Specific request**: "deliberately non accessibility with a few issues"
- **Technology constraint**: "use plain html"
- **Educational intent**: The prompt implied learning/demonstration purposes

### Alternative Prompts You Could Try:

```
Create an accessibility audit example with before/after HTML pages showing WCAG violations and fixes
```

```
Build a web accessibility training demo with HTML files showing common a11y issues and their solutions
```

```
Generate a complete accessibility learning project with problematic HTML and corrected versions plus documentation
```

### Tips for Getting Better Results from Claude 4:

1. **Be specific about the educational goal**: Mention if it's for learning, training, or demonstration
2. **Request both problems and solutions**: Ask for "before and after" examples
3. **Specify documentation needs**: Ask for explanations if you want them
4. **Mention standards**: Reference WCAG, Section 508, or specific compliance levels if needed
5. **Request testing guidance**: Ask for information about how to test the results

### Example Enhanced Prompt:
```
Create a comprehensive web accessibility learning project with:
- An HTML page with 10+ deliberate accessibility violations
- A fixed version demonstrating WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Documentation explaining each issue and fix
- Testing recommendations for manual and automated accessibility testing
Use semantic HTML and include real-world examples that developers commonly encounter
```

## Files in this project:

1. **accessibility-issues-demo.html** - Shows common accessibility violations
2. **accessibility-fixed-demo.html** - Shows the same content with proper accessibility implementation
3. **README.md** - This documentation file

## Common Accessibility Issues Demonstrated

### 1. **Poor Color Contrast**
- **Issue**: Yellow background with white text (fails WCAG contrast requirements)
- **Fix**: Use high contrast colors (dark text on light background or vice versa)
- **WCAG Guideline**: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - AA level requires 4.5:1 ratio for normal text

### 2. **Missing Alt Text on Images**
- **Issue**: Images without alt attributes or inappropriate alt text
- **Fix**: 
  - Informative images: Descriptive alt text
  - Decorative images: Empty alt text (`alt=""`) or `role="presentation"`
- **WCAG Guideline**: 1.1.1 Non-text Content

### 3. **Improper Heading Hierarchy**
- **Issue**: Skipping heading levels (h3 before h1)
- **Fix**: Use headings in logical order (h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3, etc.)
- **WCAG Guideline**: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships

### 4. **Forms Without Proper Labels**
- **Issue**: Form inputs without associated labels or with hidden labels
- **Fix**: 
  - Use `<label for="input-id">` properly
  - Add `aria-describedby` for additional help text
  - Use `required` attribute for required fields
- **WCAG Guideline**: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships, 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions

### 5. **Non-Semantic Interactive Elements**
- **Issue**: Using `<div>` with click handlers instead of proper buttons
- **Fix**: Use semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<a>`, etc.)
- **WCAG Guideline**: 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value

### 6. **Poor Link Text**
- **Issue**: "Click here" and "Read more" links without context
- **Fix**: Use descriptive link text that makes sense out of context
- **WCAG Guideline**: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)

### 7. **Data Tables Without Headers**
- **Issue**: Tables without proper `<th>` elements and scope attributes
- **Fix**: 
  - Use `<th>` for headers
  - Add `scope="col"` or `scope="row"`
  - Include `<caption>` for table description
- **WCAG Guideline**: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships

### 8. **Blinking/Flashing Content**
- **Issue**: Content that blinks or flashes automatically
- **Fix**: Remove auto-animations or provide controls to stop them
- **WCAG Guideline**: 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold

### 9. **Text Too Small**
- **Issue**: Text smaller than 16px (or equivalent)
- **Fix**: Use appropriate font sizes (minimum 16px for body text)
- **WCAG Guideline**: 1.4.4 Resize text

### 10. **Missing Language Declaration**
- **Issue**: No `lang` attribute on `<html>` element
- **Fix**: Add `lang="en"` (or appropriate language code)
- **WCAG Guideline**: 3.1.1 Language of Page

### 11. **Auto-playing Media**
- **Issue**: Videos that auto-play without user control
- **Fix**: 
  - Remove autoplay
  - Provide controls
  - Add captions/transcripts
- **WCAG Guideline**: 1.4.2 Audio Control, 1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only

### 12. **Inaccessible Custom Controls**
- **Issue**: Custom dropdowns without keyboard support or ARIA attributes
- **Fix**: 
  - Use native `<select>` elements when possible
  - Add proper ARIA attributes for custom controls
  - Ensure keyboard accessibility
- **WCAG Guideline**: 2.1.1 Keyboard, 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value

### 13. **Poor Focus Management**
- **Issue**: Elements that can receive focus but don't provide clear focus indicators
- **Fix**: 
  - Ensure visible focus indicators
  - Proper tab order
  - Don't use `tabindex` > 0
- **WCAG Guideline**: 2.4.7 Focus Visible, 2.4.3 Focus Order

## Accessibility Best Practices Implemented in the Fixed Version

### Semantic HTML Structure
- Proper use of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`
- Logical heading hierarchy
- Semantic form elements with proper labeling

### ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
- `aria-label` for navigation
- `aria-describedby` for form help text
