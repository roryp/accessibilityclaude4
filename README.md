# Accessibility Issues Demo - Learning Guide

This project demonstrates common web accessibility issues and their solutions through two HTML files: one with deliberate accessibility problems and another showing how to fix them. Perfect for developers learning accessibility best practices.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Explore the demos**: Open both HTML files in your browser
   - `accessibility-issues-demo.html` - Shows common accessibility violations
   - `accessibility-fixed-demo.html` - Shows proper accessibility implementation
2. **Compare the differences**: Use keyboard navigation and screen readers on both
3. **Run accessibility tests**: Use automated tools to see the violations
4. **Learn from the patterns**: Review this guide to understand each issue and fix

## What You'll Learn

This project covers **13+ common accessibility issues** that developers encounter:

### Core Issues Demonstrated

1. **Poor Color Contrast** - Yellow text on white backgrounds that fail WCAG standards
2. **Missing Alt Text** - Images without proper alternative text descriptions
3. **Improper Heading Hierarchy** - Skipping heading levels (h3 before h1)
4. **Forms Without Labels** - Input fields missing proper labels and instructions
5. **Non-Semantic Elements** - Using divs instead of proper buttons and links
6. **Poor Link Text** - "Click here" links that lack context
7. **Data Tables Without Headers** - Tables missing proper th elements and scope
8. **Blinking/Flashing Content** - Auto-animations that can trigger seizures
9. **Text Too Small** - Font sizes below 16px that are hard to read
10. **Missing Language Declaration** - No lang attribute on HTML element
11. **Auto-playing Media** - Videos that auto-play without user control
12. **Inaccessible Custom Controls** - Dropdowns without keyboard support
13. **Poor Focus Management** - Elements without visible focus indicators

### Best Practices You'll Master

- **Semantic HTML Structure** with proper landmarks
- **ARIA Implementation** for complex interactive elements
- **Keyboard Accessibility** patterns and focus management
- **Screen Reader Support** with descriptive content
- **Color and Contrast** meeting WCAG AA standards
- **Responsive Design** with touch-friendly targets

## üß™ Testing Your Accessibility

### Manual Testing
1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through both demos - notice the differences
2. **Screen Reader**: Use NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to hear how they sound
3. **Visual Inspection**: Check color contrast and text sizing
4. **Browser Tools**: Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse accessibility audit

### Automated Testing Tools
- **Accessibility Insights** - Microsoft's free browser extension ([Download](https://accessibilityinsights.io/downloads))
- **axe DevTools** - Browser extension for automated accessibility testing
- **WAVE** - Web accessibility evaluation tool
- **Lighthouse** - Built into Chrome DevTools

### üìä Continuous Integration Testing

This project includes **three automated testing workflows** that run on every push and pull request:

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (axe-core)
**Location:** `.github/workflows/accessibility-check.yml`

- Tests both HTML files with axe-core engine
- Generates detailed HTML reports with violation descriptions
- Uploads results as downloadable artifacts
- Comments on pull requests with findings
- Fails builds if fixed demo has serious violations

#### Pa11y Command-Line Testing  
**Location:** `.github/workflows/pa11y.yml`

- Industry-standard command-line accessibility testing
- Tests against WCAG2AA standards with concurrent execution
- Provides CLI-focused reports ideal for developers
- Automatically comments on pull requests with collapsible results

#### ü§ñ AI-Powered Accessibility Analysis
**Location:** `.github/workflows/ai_accessibility_check.yml`

- **Simplified approach**: Uses TinyLlama (1.1B parameter) language model running locally in GitHub Actions
- Directly analyzes raw HTML content with natural language prompts
- Generates human-readable accessibility insights and recommendations
- Very lightweight: ~1.4GB model download, minimal dependencies (only `requests`)
- Provides experimental AI perspective on common accessibility issues
- Supplements (doesn't replace) dedicated testing tools like axe-core and Pa11y

**What it checks for:**
- Missing alt attributes on images
- Forms without proper labels
- Missing or incorrect heading structure
- Potential color contrast issues
- Missing language attributes

**Why TinyLlama?** Despite being only 1.1B parameters, TinyLlama can effectively identify common accessibility patterns and explain issues in natural language while running efficiently in CI environments.

**How it works:**
1. Installs Ollama and pulls TinyLlama model
2. Creates a simple Python analyzer script
3. Reads HTML files and sends content to AI with accessibility prompt
4. Generates both JSON data and markdown reports
5. Comments on pull requests with AI findings

**Expected Results:**
- Issues demo: Multiple violations (expected behavior)
- Fixed demo: Zero or minimal violations

#### Running Tests Locally

**axe-core testing:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/cli puppeteer serve
npx serve . -l 3000 &
npx axe http://localhost:3000/accessibility-issues-demo.html --reporter json
```

**Pa11y testing:**
```bash
npm install -g pa11y-ci
python -m http.server 8080
pa11y http://localhost:8080/accessibility-issues-demo.html --standard WCAG2AA --runner axe
```

**AI accessibility testing (requires Ollama):**
```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh   # Linux/macOS
# Or download from website for Windows

# Pull TinyLlama model
ollama pull tinyllama

# Start Ollama service (if not auto-started)
ollama serve

# Install Python requests
pip install requests

# Run the AI analyzer (extract from workflow or create simple script)
python ai_accessibility_analyzer.py
```

## üìã WCAG 2.1 Compliance Reference

- **Level A**: Minimum accessibility (basic compliance)
- **Level AA**: Standard level - **recommended for most websites**
- **Level AAA**: Highest level (required for government/critical services)

Most organizations target **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** for the best balance of accessibility and practicality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixing Issues with AI Assistance

### Using GitHub Copilot

You can use GitHub Copilot to quickly identify and fix accessibility issues. Here are effective prompts:

```
Fix all color contrast issues in this HTML file to meet WCAG AA standards.
```

```
Add missing alt text to all images and use empty alt for decorative images.
```

```
Correct the heading hierarchy so it starts with <h1> and follows logical order.
```

```
Make all form fields properly labeled and ensure semantic button elements.
```

### Tips for AI-Assisted Accessibility Work
- Be specific about WCAG guidelines ("fix to meet WCAG 2.1 AA")
- Ask for explanations along with fixes to learn the patterns
- Always test AI-generated solutions with accessibility tools
- Validate with real users when possible

## ü§ñ How This Project Was Created

This comprehensive accessibility demo was generated using GitHub Copilot with Claude 4 using this simple prompt:

```
create a simple html file to showcase how to fix accessibility issues. make the page deliberately non accessibility with a few issues. use plain html
```

**What AI Generated:**
- Two complete HTML files (broken and fixed versions)
- 13+ realistic accessibility violations and their solutions
- Comprehensive documentation with WCAG mapping
- Three automated testing workflows (axe-core, Pa11y, and AI-powered analysis)
- AI accessibility checker using TinyLlama for experimental insights
- Learning guidance and best practices

**Why It Worked:** The prompt was specific about the educational goal, requested both problems and solutions, and specified the technology constraint (plain HTML).

### Alternative Prompts for Similar Projects
```
Create an accessibility audit training kit with before/after HTML examples
Build a WCAG compliance demo with real-world accessibility violations
