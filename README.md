![image](image.png)
This project demonstrates common web accessibility issues and their solutions through two HTML files: one with deliberate accessibility problems and another showing how to fix them. Perfect for developers learning accessibility best practices.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Explore the demos**: Open both HTML files in your browser
   - `accessibility-issues-demo.html` - Shows common accessibility violations
   - `accessibility-fixed-demo.html` - Shows proper accessibility implementation
2. **Compare the differences**: Use keyboard navigation and screen readers on both
3. **Run accessibility tests**: Use automated tools to see the violations
4. **Learn from the patterns**: Review this guide to understand each issue and fix

## What You'll Learn

This project covers **13+ common accessibility issues** that developers encounter:

### Core Issues Demonstrated

1. **Poor Color Contrast** - Yellow text on white backgrounds that fail WCAG standards
2. **Missing Alt Text** - Images without proper alternative text descriptions
3. **Improper Heading Hierarchy** - Skipping heading levels (h3 before h1)
4. **Forms Without Labels** - Input fields missing proper labels and instructions
5. **Non-Semantic Elements** - Using divs instead of proper buttons and links
6. **Poor Link Text** - "Click here" links that lack context
7. **Data Tables Without Headers** - Tables missing proper th elements and scope
8. **Blinking/Flashing Content** - Auto-animations that can trigger seizures
9. **Text Too Small** - Font sizes below 16px that are hard to read
10. **Missing Language Declaration** - No lang attribute on HTML element
11. **Auto-playing Media** - Videos that auto-play without user control
12. **Inaccessible Custom Controls** - Dropdowns without keyboard support
13. **Poor Focus Management** - Elements without visible focus indicators

### Best Practices You'll Master

- **Advanced AI Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o via GitHub Models for comprehensive accessibility analysis
- Analyzes HTML content with sophisticated understanding of WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Generates detailed, human-readable insights and actionable recommendations
- Provides expert-level accessibility consultation in natural language
- Supplements (doesn't replace) dedicated testing tools like axe-core and Pa11y

**Setup Required:**
1. Get a GitHub Models API token from [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models)
2. Add it as a repository secret named `MODELS_TOKEN`
3. See `.github/workflows/README.md` for detailed setup instructions

**What it analyzes:**
- Semantic HTML structure and heading hierarchy
- Images and media accessibility (alt text quality)
- Forms and interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation patterns
- Color and contrast compliance
- ARIA implementation
- Document structure and language attributes
- Dynamic content and live regions

**Why GPT-4o?** GPT-4o provides expert-level accessibility analysis with deep understanding of accessibility principles, user impact, and detailed remediation guidance.

**How it works:**
1. Installs Ollama and pulls TinyLlama model
2. Creates a simple Python analyzer script
3. Reads HTML files and sends content to AI with accessibility prompt
4. Generates both JSON data and markdown reports
5. Comments on pull requests with AI findings

**Expected Results:**
- Issues demo: Multiple violations (expected behavior)
- Fixed demo: Zero or minimal violations

#### Running Tests Locally

**axe-core testing:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/cli puppeteer serve
npx serve . -l 3000 &
npx axe http://localhost:3000/accessibility-issues-demo.html --reporter json
```

**Pa11y testing:**
```bash
npm install -g pa11y-ci
python -m http.server 8080
pa11y http://localhost:8080/accessibility-issues-demo.html --standard WCAG2AA --runner axe
```

**AI accessibility testing (requires Ollama):**
```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh   # Linux/macOS
# Or download from website for Windows

# Pull TinyLlama model
ollama pull tinyllama

# Start Ollama service (if not auto-started)
ollama serve

# Install Python requests
pip install requests

# Run the AI analyzer (extract from workflow or create simple script)
python ai_accessibility_analyzer.py
```

## üìã WCAG 2.1 Compliance Reference

- **Level A**: Minimum accessibility (basic compliance)
- **Level AA**: Standard level - **recommended for most websites**
- **Level AAA**: Highest level (required for government/critical services)

Most organizations target **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance** for the best balance of accessibility and practicality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixing Issues with AI Assistance

## ü§ñ How This Project Was Created

This comprehensive accessibility demo was generated using GitHub Copilot with Claude 4 using this simple prompt:

```
create a simple html file to showcase how to fix accessibility issues. make the page deliberately non accessibility with a few issues. use plain html
```

**What AI Generated:**
- Two complete HTML files (broken and fixed versions)
- 13+ realistic accessibility violations and their solutions
- Comprehensive documentation with WCAG mapping
- Three automated testing workflows (axe-core, Pa11y, and AI-powered analysis)
- AI accessibility checker using TinyLlama for experimental insights
- Learning guidance and best practices

**Why It Worked:** The prompt was specific about the educational goal, requested both problems and solutions, and specified the technology constraint (plain HTML).
